Instructions

1. Open the .lcpl file in Thorium
2. In Thorium, right-click the book and export it as an .lcpa file
3. Run the script (lcpdedrm.exe OR lcpdedrm.py, depending on OS and preference)
4. When the first dialog appears, select the .lcpa file
5. Enter your passphrase in the second dialog
	5.1 The passphrase you enter will be saved to a file ("passphrase.txt") and suggested the next time you will run the script
6. All decrypted files will be in a folder in the same directory as the .lcpa file
	6.1 If the .lcpa file contains an image file for the audiobook (.jpg, .jpeg or .png), it will automatically be copied to the output folder

Notes
- This code was tested on Windows and Linux
- In the instructions I use Thorium as the LCP audiobook reader, but this can be done with any similar software
